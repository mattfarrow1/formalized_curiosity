Building upon my previous Apra North Texas talk, Excel is a ubiquitous program in today's office environment. It is also incredibly under-utilized. In this talk, I'll share some simple tricks to harness more of the power of Excel to make your work more efficient. This talk is specifically tailored to the fundraising and prospect development community.
