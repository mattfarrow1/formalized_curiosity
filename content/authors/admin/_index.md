"Research is formalized curiosity. It is poking and prying with a purpose."

*Zora Neale Hurston*

I'm currently the Assistant Director of Prospect Management at SMU. Over the last few years, I've developed a passion for `R` and [RStudio](https://www.rstudio.com) and, as my skills have increased, so too has my desire to find more ways to incorporate it into my daily work.

I first heard about `R` on the [Prospect-dmm listserve](https://mailman.mit.edu/mailman/listinfo/prospect-dmm) and was intrigued by the idea of bring reproducibility to my work and not recreating the wheel every time I opened Excel. What began with taking prospecting work that I would do in Excel and converting that in an `R` script that I'd run every couple of weeks has transformed into a tool that I use almost daily for a variety of projects. 

This site is designed to be a place to share some of those interesting projects, especially for my fellow Prospect Development friends; develop my skills; and document things that I'm always referring back to for posterity.
