## Switched Modified Date to Published Date

https://discourse.gohugo.io/t/configure-how-lastmod-date-is-assigned/14190

This was behaving as expected in my development environment.

But when I would deploy to Netlify, the .Lastmod date was showing the date that the file had last been edited, not the lastmod value I had set in the postâ€™s front matter.

After exploring the docs, I learned that the default configuration for lastmod is to use the Git author date for the last revision of the file. But only if --enableGitInfo is passed, or enableGitInfo = true is set in site config.

Turns out, I had HUGO_ENABLEGITINFO = "true" set in my netlify.toml file.
