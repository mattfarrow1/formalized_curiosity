<h2>Switched Modified Date to Published Date</h2>

<p>This was behaving as expected in my development environment.</p>
<p>But when I would deploy to Netlify, the .Lastmod date was showing the date that the file had last been edited, not the lastmod value I had set in the post’s front matter.</p>
<p>After exploring the docs, I learned that the default configuration for lastmod is to use the Git author date for the last revision of the file. But only if –enableGitInfo is passed, or enableGitInfo = true is set in site config.</p>
<p>Turns out, I had HUGO_ENABLEGITINFO = “true” set in my netlify.toml file.</p>
